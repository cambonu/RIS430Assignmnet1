  issues such as a slowdown in SSH connections.","'- DHE key exchange should be disabled if no other mitigation
  mechanism can be used and either elliptic-curve variant of Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or RSA key
  exchange is supported by the clients. The fact that RSA key exchange is not forward secret should
  be considered.

  - Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections in e.g. the configuration of the remote
  server. For Postfix this limit can be configured via 'smtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit'
  option, for other products please refer to the manual of the product in question on configuration
  possibilities.",,"'- CVE-2002-20001: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol
  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
  vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

  - CVE-2024-41996: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
  Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to
  trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client
  may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate
  the order of the public key.","Checks the supported cipher suites of the remote SSL/TLS

Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.

This service seems to be able to host ASP scripts.

Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for web application scanning. You can enable this again with the ""Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

The following directories were used for web application scanning:

Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

This service is marked as broken and no web application scanning is launched against it. Reason(s):
-----
 - The remote web server is very slow - it took 206 seconds (Maximum response time configured in 'Response Time / No 404 Error Code Check' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10386) preferences: 60 seconds) to execute the plugin no404.nasl (it usually only takes a few seconds).

In order to keep the scan total time to a reasonable amount, the remote web server has not been tested.

If the remote server should be tested it has to be fixed to have it reply to the scanners requests in a reasonable amount of time. Alternatively the 'Maximum response time (in seconds)' preference could be raised to a higher value if longer scan times are accepted.
