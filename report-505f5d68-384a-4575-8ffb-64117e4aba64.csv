  1) Race condition in sshd(8)

  A critical vulnerability in sshd(8) was present that may allow arbitrary code execution with root
  privileges.

  Successful exploitation has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc systems with ASLR. Under lab
  conditions, the attack requires on average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum
  the server will accept. Exploitation on 64-bit systems is believed to be possible but has not been
  demonstrated at this time. It's likely that these attacks will be improved upon.

  Exploitation on non-glibc systems is conceivable but has not been examined. Systems that lack ASLR
  or users of downstream Linux distributions that have modified OpenSSH to disable per-connection
  ASLR re-randomisation (yes - this is a thing, no - we don't understand why) may potentially have
  an easier path to exploitation.

  - It seems that some of the flaws could be mitigated by workarounds (listed in the referenced
  GitHub Gist) via either configuration changes and/or by disabling some features / functionality
  of Squid during build time

  previous listed vulnerabilities is largely unclear (The security researcher only stated that all
  vulnerabilities were discovered in squid-5.0.5 and the vendor only published a few advisories so
  far).

  Due to this unclear situation all Squid versions are currently assumed to be vulnerable by the not
  yet fixed flaws.","The following flaws have been reported in 2021 to the vendor and
  seems to be not fixed yet:

  - One-Byte Buffer OverRead in HTTP Request Header Parsing

  - strlen(NULL) Crash Using Digest Authentication GHSA-254c-93q9-cp53

  - Gopher Assertion Crash

  - Whois Assertion Crash

  - RFC 2141 / 2169 (URN) Assertion Crash

  - Assertion in Negotiate/NTLM Authentication Using Pipeline Prefetching

  - Assertion on IPv6 Host Requests with --disable-ipv6

  - Assertion Crash on Unexpected 'HTTP/1.1 100 Continue' Response Header

  There could be an increase in CPU usage in the affected component. For OpenSSH, users may observe
  issues such as a slowdown in SSH connections.","'- DHE key exchange should be disabled if no other mitigation
  mechanism can be used and either elliptic-curve variant of Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or RSA key
  exchange is supported by the clients. The fact that RSA key exchange is not forward secret should
  be considered.

  - Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections in e.g. the configuration of the remote
  server. For Postfix this limit can be configured via 'smtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit'
  option, for other products please refer to the manual of the product in question on configuration
  possibilities.","","'- CVE-2002-20001: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol
  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE

  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this

  option, for other products please refer to the manual of the product in question on configuration
  possibilities.","","'- CVE-2002-20001: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol
  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
  vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

  - CVE-2024-41996: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
  Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to
  trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client
  may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate
  the order of the public key.","Checks the supported cipher suites of the remote SSL/TLS

  Mitigation:

  - To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called 'strict kex' which alters
  the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages
  as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes. Support for strict key exchange
  has been added to a variety of SSH implementations, including OpenSSH itself, PuTTY, libssh, and
  more.

  Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.

  As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use
  unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.","Systems supporting the following encryption algorithm and/or

  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at
  runtime.

  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timestamps=disabled'

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
