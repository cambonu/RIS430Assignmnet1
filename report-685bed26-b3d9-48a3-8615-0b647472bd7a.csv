A permission leak could have occurred from a trusted site to an untrusted site via embed or object elements.

CVE-2024-10459: Use-after-free in layout with accessibility
An attacker could have caused a use-after-free when accessibility was enabled, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2024-10460: Confusing display of origin for external protocol handler prompt
The origin of an external protocol handler prompt could have been obscured using a data: URL within an iframe.

CVE-2024-10461: XSS due to Content-Disposition being ignored in multipart/x-mixed-replace response
In multipart/x-mixed-replace responses, Content-Disposition: attachment in the response header was not respected and did not force a download, which could allow XSS attacks.

CVE-2024-10462: Origin of permission prompt could be spoofed by long URL
Truncation of a long URL could have allowed origin spoofing in a permission prompt.

CVE-2024-10463: Cross origin video frame leak
Video frames could have been leaked between origins in some situations.

  EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in
  OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in
  order to implement custom ciphers.

  OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the
  EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other
  similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom
  cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers.
  An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is
  supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application
  to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef
  is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL
  cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if
  the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers
  this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext.

  Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef
  and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function.

  to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations, also known as a D(HE)ater attack.

  There could be an increase in CPU usage in the affected component. For OpenSSH, users may observe
  issues such as a slowdown in SSH connections.","'- DHE key exchange should be disabled if no other mitigation
  mechanism can be used and either elliptic-curve variant of Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or RSA key
  exchange is supported by the clients. The fact that RSA key exchange is not forward secret should
  be considered.

  - Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections in e.g. the configuration of the remote
  server. For OpenSSH this limit can be configured via the 'MaxStartups' option, for other products
  please refer to the manual of the product in question on configuration possibilities.","","'- CVE-2002-20001: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol
  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
  vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

  - CVE-2024-41996: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
  Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to
  trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client
  may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate
  the order of the public key.","Checks the supported KEX algorithms of the remote SSH

  EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in
  OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in
  order to implement custom ciphers.

  OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the
  EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other
  similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom
  cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers.
  An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is
  supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application
  to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef
  is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL
  cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if
  the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers
  this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext.

  Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef
  and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function.

A compromised content process could have allowed for the arbitrary loading of cross-origin pages.

CVE-2024-9393: Cross-origin access to PDF contents through multipart responses
An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the resource://pdf.js origin. This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content. This access is limited to 'same site' documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions.

CVE-2024-9394: Cross-origin access to JSON contents through multipart responses
An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the resource://devtools origin. This could allow them to access cross-origin JSON content. This access is limited to 'same site' documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions.

CVE-2024-9396: Potential memory corruption may occur when cloning certain objects
It is currently unknown if this issue is exploitable but a condition may arise where the structured clone of certain objects could lead to memory corruption.

CVE-2024-9397: Potential directory upload bypass via clickjacking
A missing delay in directory upload UI could have made it possible for an attacker to trick a user into granting permission via clickjacking.

CVE-2024-9398: External protocol handlers could be enumerated via popups
By checking the result of calls to window.open with specifically set protocol handlers, an attacker could determine if the application which implements that protocol handler is installed.

CVE-2024-9399: Specially crafted WebTransport requests could lead to denial of service
A website configured to initiate a specially crafted WebTransport session could crash the Firefox process leading to a denial of service condition.

CVE-2024-9400: Potential memory corruption during JIT compilation
A potential memory corruption vulnerability could be triggered if an attacker had the ability to trigger an OOM at a specific moment during JIT compilation.

  mechanism can be used and either elliptic-curve variant of Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or RSA key

  server. For Postfix this limit can be configured via 'smtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit'
  option, for other products please refer to the manual of the product in question on configuration
  possibilities.","","'- CVE-2002-20001: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol
  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
  vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

  - CVE-2024-41996: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
  Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to
  trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client
  may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate
  the order of the public key.","Checks the supported cipher suites of the remote SSL/TLS

  Mitigation:

  - To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called 'strict kex' which alters
  the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages
  as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes. Support for strict key exchange
  has been added to a variety of SSH implementations, including OpenSSH itself, PuTTY, libssh, and
  more.

  Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.

  unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.","Systems supporting the following encryption algorithm and/or
