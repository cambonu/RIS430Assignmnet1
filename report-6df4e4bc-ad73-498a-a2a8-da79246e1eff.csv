A permission leak could have occurred from a trusted site to an untrusted site via embed or object elements.

CVE-2024-10459: Use-after-free in layout with accessibility
An attacker could have caused a use-after-free when accessibility was enabled, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2024-10460: Confusing display of origin for external protocol handler prompt
The origin of an external protocol handler prompt could have been obscured using a data: URL within an iframe.

CVE-2024-10461: XSS due to Content-Disposition being ignored in multipart/x-mixed-replace response
In multipart/x-mixed-replace responses, Content-Disposition: attachment in the response header was not respected and did not force a download, which could allow XSS attacks.

CVE-2024-10462: Origin of permission prompt could be spoofed by long URL
Truncation of a long URL could have allowed origin spoofing in a permission prompt.

CVE-2024-10463: Cross origin video frame leak
Video frames could have been leaked between origins in some situations.

CVE-2024-10468: Race conditions in IndexedDB
Potential race conditions in IndexedDB could have caused memory corruption, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

CVE-2024-10464: History interface could have been used to cause a Denial of Service condition in the browser
Repeated writes to history interface attributes could have been used to cause a Denial of Service condition in the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to this API.

  mechanism can be used and either elliptic-curve variant of Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or RSA key
  exchange is supported by the clients. The fact that RSA key exchange is not forward secret should
  be considered.

  - Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections in e.g. the configuration of the remote
  server. For OpenSSH this limit can be configured via the 'MaxStartups' option, for other products
  please refer to the manual of the product in question on configuration possibilities.","","'- CVE-2002-20001: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol
  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
  vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

  - CVE-2024-41996: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
  Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to
  trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client
  may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate
  the order of the public key.","Checks the supported KEX algorithms of the remote SSH

  to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations, also known as a D(HE)ater attack.

  issues such as a slowdown in SSH connections.","'- DHE key exchange should be disabled if no other mitigation
  mechanism can be used and either elliptic-curve variant of Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or RSA key
  exchange is supported by the clients. The fact that RSA key exchange is not forward secret should
  be considered.

  - Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections in e.g. the configuration of the remote
  server. For Postfix this limit can be configured via 'smtpd_client_new_tls_session_rate_limit'
  option, for other products please refer to the manual of the product in question on configuration
  possibilities.","","'- CVE-2002-20001: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol
  allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
  public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a
  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may
  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
  vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

  - CVE-2024-41996: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
  Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to
  trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client
  may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate
  the order of the public key.","Checks the supported cipher suites of the remote SSL/TLS

  - For other products please contact the vendor for possible fixes / updates

  Mitigation:

  - To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called 'strict kex' which alters
  the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages
  as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes. Support for strict key exchange
  has been added to a variety of SSH implementations, including OpenSSH itself, PuTTY, libssh, and
  more.

  Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.

  As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use
  unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.","Systems supporting the following encryption algorithm and/or
